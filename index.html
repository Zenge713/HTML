	<p> I grew up in a small town called Alvin, which is located south of Houston, Texas. I would frequent the beaches of Galveston to go skateboarding because the area was so nice. </p>
	<p> Although I was a graduating junior, I was allowed to walk with the class of '08 so I was surrounded by my friends. I still somehow managed to be within the top 15% of the class!
	I did find that graduating early was extremely boring and eventually left my hometown to travel and work on the pipeline with my dad.</p>
	<p> The relevance of the Jack Black picture is warranted as I'm often mistaken as Jack Black when I grow my hair out. It can definitely make for a good conversation starter!
	Not only that, but in hindsight it would make dressing up for Halloween pretty easy. </p>
	<p> After years of hard work and not really happy with my job prospects, I decided to go back to college and do what I had always wanted to do but never followed those dreams. That dream
	is taking me down the path of coding, and with all things considered that 2020 has brought... I would dare to say it's turned out to be a rather exciting year.</p>
