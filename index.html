               <h2>The final frontier, dare to explore?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I've always been in awe of the great unknown, or what's often referred to as the final frontier. My interest in came to me at a very young age and I could often be found watching Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stargate. 
               There's something mysterious about the vast galaxy that's seemingly infinite. It's unknown if we're alone, or if there's intelligent life somewhere out there on a distant planet. There's so much space (pun intended) between us
               and planets that could potentially contain life and we haven't the technology to travel the distance within our lifetime. There's a famous quote by Author C. Clarke, "Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.‚Äù
               This holds true no matter who you are or what you believe. Although we were born a little over 500 years too late to explore the Earth, we are probably born a little over 100 years too soon to explore outer space. <br>
            </p>

               If you have the an itch like I do to explore space, then you're in luck!
               One of my favorite games is called Elite Dangerous. Elite Dangerous is a 1:1 replica of the Milky Way galaxy based on real scientific principles. Planets and moons even orbit celestial bodies, so they're never in the same place. Although, the orbits are real time, it's still 
               nothing short of incredible to be able to visit distant planets. There's plenty of lore behind the game as well because... Well, it's a game. So there's some fantasy aspects to it obviously, but it's still gives you the ability to explore and see some gorgeous systems and unique
               stars that would otherwise look like a ball of light in a telescope, assuming your telescope is powerful enough to see the object to begin with. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
               If you are someone who plays Elite Dangerous, perhaps you'll enjoy the collection of screenshots I've gathered. Be sure to fly safe commander. o7
